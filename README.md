Setting Up a Domain Controller in Azure

To set up a Domain Controller in Azure, create a Resource Group, then set up a Virtual Network and Subnet. Deploy a Windows Server 2022 VM (DC-1) with a static Private IP, disable the Windows Firewall, and configure it as a Domain Controller. Next, create a Windows 10 Client VM (Client-1), attach it to the same Virtual Network, and configure its DNS settings to point to DC-1â€™s Private IP. Restart Client-1, verify connectivity by pinging DC-1, and confirm DNS settings with ipconfig /all in PowerShell. These steps establish the foundation for further Active Directory configurations in Azure.

Part 1: Setting Up Active Directory
Install Active Directory
Log into DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services.
Promote DC-1 to a Domain Controller, creating a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com).
Restart and log back in as mydomain.com\labuser.
Create a Domain Admin User
In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create the following OUs:
_EMPLOYEES
_ADMINS
Create a user Jane Doe (jane_admin / Cyberlab123!).
Add jane_admin to the Domain Admins security group.
Log out and back in as mydomain.com\jane_adminâ€”this is now your admin account.
Join Client-1 to the Domain
Ensure Client-1â€™s DNS is set to DC-1â€™s Private IP.
Restart Client-1 from the Azure Portal.
Log into Client-1 as labuser and join it to the domain.
Verify Client-1 appears in ADUC, then move it to the _CLIENTS OU.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Donâ€™t delete the VMs after completing the lab. To save costs, stop them in Azure Portal.

Part 2: Configuring Remote Desktop & User Accounts
Enable Remote Desktop for Domain Users
Log into Client-1 as jane_admin.
Open System Properties â†’ Remote Desktop â†’ Allow domain users.
You can now log into Client-1 as a standard domain user.
Create Additional Users & Test Login
Log into DC-1 as jane_admin.
Open PowerShell_ISE as Administrator and run a script to create users.
Verify new users in ADUC under _EMPLOYEES.
Attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the newly created accounts.
